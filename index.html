        <div id="efe">
	<p>First to say that I will not say my real name. You can call me "137".</p><br>
	
        <h2 id="l1">Who Am I?</h2>
		
        <p>I am nobody, only a nerdy boy whitout friends.</p>
        <img id="gif-text" src="https://i.gifer.com/FUtt.gif">
	<br>
	<p>I am a sociable boy, but without the possibility of it.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, I speak Spanish, a little English, a little Italian and a little French.</p>
	<p>Despite the meaning of my real name, I am an atheist, a very purist atheist. I can't stand superstitious or religious references, and yet my parents had the subtlety to name me after an ancient god of I don't know what religion.</p><br>
	<p>I love math and science fiction books, but not just any science fiction; well-grounded science fiction. No Star Wars or Star Trek, I'm into A Space Odyssey, Solar Storm, Glade of Earth, etc. <br>
	However, in my family nobody likes these topics very much, they are not very fond of talking about computers, quantum computers, science, fiction books, mathematics... well, I am alone on an island of the intellect, lost in a sea of loneliness.</p>
	<p>By the way, if you find this website a bit bad, you should know that it is because I have made it by hand, writing each line of code. So, if you have any problems or suggestions... please let me know via contact email, or you can leave me a comment on GitHub.</p>
	<p>My family is made up of: A mother with whom I do not share many points of view, a father with whom I do not agree on certain opinions, an older brother whom I hate, a black cat with whom I have a love relationship/ I hate and a beautiful Shiba Inu who is the person in my family that I love the most.</p>

	<p>This photo is from 2011 or 2012, I'm not sure. She is my sister and her name is Kikum√≥.</p><br>
        
	<h2 id="l2">How Is My Life?</h2>
		
	<p>My life is very lonely. Certain circumstances in my life have led me to not be able to maintain much contact with society and with other people in general. And no, I am not a convict, I am a young man who was dragged into solitude.<br>
        This is why I write this website, you will not know my name, but at least you will know my story.</p>
	<p>I have a crush, that type of crush that is a famous person and that I will never meet but I still have this strange hope that I can meet and love her, despite being impossible.<br>
	It makes me very depressed because I know I should forget her, but... I don't know why I can't. When I think about this it makes me want to cry my eyes out.</p>
	<img src="https://i.gifer.com/43AX.gif"><br>
	<p>It is not the first time in my life that I have experienced an unrequited love, I would say that all the loves of my life have been unrequited. This has been going on since I was 4 years old.</p>
	<p>When all the people you have loved in your life do not show the same as you, and also you have been too scared to tell them what you feel, it becomes very difficult and you begin to doubt if you will ever find someone who loves you.</p><br>
	<p>And that is, in general terms, my life.</p><br>
	
	<h2 id="l3">What Is My Story?</h2>
	<p>This is a long story that is not over yet, it has only just begun.</p>
	<p>Do you want to know it? come with me...</p><br>
	<br>
	<p>I was born on September 16, 2006, a very ordinary date. I wonder why most couples think of conceiving on December 24? The truth is that I was not expected, I caught my parents by surprise, but they took it with joy.</p>
	<p>My parents weren't exactly rich. Do you remember the crisis of 2008? Well, my parents were already financially sensitive before that.</p>
	<p>When I was born, my parents already had a son. My older brother was quite rowdy.<br>
	An important fact is that he was born with a sensitivity in the bronchi, this is important to understand the rest of the story.</p>
	<p>My brother was boisterous and certainly difficult. I, however, was extremely quiet, so much so that my parents thought he was deaf: they put the alarm clock to my ear but I didn't wake up. I was like that until I grew up and started screaming so loud that they echoed through all the walls, causing a ringing in the ears. I became a screaming child, yelling my brother's name in anger became part of me.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the doctors told my parents that my brother, 2 years older than me, would be chronically asthmatic, among other things. My parents decided to rent a house in a town in the mountains. I entered school there for the first time. She was 4 years old and the dearest companion of all the children in the school. This was so because I was the smallest of all, which made them fight to hold my hand; they were little too, but I was the baby, and I was good at playing the part.</p>
	<p>My mother, my brother and I were there for a few months. I made my first friends there, which were also the last.</p>
	<p>It turned out that when we went to school, the classmates gave my brother all their viruses and he had trouble breathing. Many times it was impossible for him to breathe and he had to go to the emergency room to see the doctor. He got to so much that he was hospitalized a few times.</p>
	<p>My parents decided to take my brother and me out of school because my brother could no longer be exposed to so much viral load in that way.</p>
	<p>I couldn't attend because it would infect my brother, and once I was out of the system I couldn't go back because home schooling isn't legal in my country.</p>
	<p>And that's how "The Lonely Man" was born...</p><br>
