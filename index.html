	<p>First to say that I will not say my real name. You can call me "The Internet Nerd".</p>
	<p>Also, this page is not optimized for mobile devices, so you'd better read it on your computer.</p><br>
	
        <h2 id="l1">Who Am I?</h2>
		
        <p>I am nobody, only a nerdy boy whitout friends.</p>
        <img id="gif-text" src="https://i.gifer.com/FUtt.gif">
	<br>
	<p>I am a sociable boy, but without the possibility of it.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, I speak Spanish, a little English, a little Italian and a little French.</p>
	<p>Despite the meaning of my real name, I am an atheist, a very purist atheist. I can't stand superstitious or religious references, and yet my parents had the subtlety to name me after an ancient god of I don't know what religion.</p><br>
	<p>I love math and science fiction books, but not just any science fiction; well-grounded science fiction. No Star Wars or Star Trek, I'm into A Space Odyssey, Solar Storm, Glade of Earth, etc. <br>
	However, in my family nobody likes these topics very much, they are not very fond of talking about computers, quantum computers, science, fiction books, mathematics... well, I am alone on an island of the intellect, lost in a sea of loneliness.</p>
	<p>By the way, if you find this website a bit bad, you should know that it is because I have made it by hand, writing each line of code. So, if you have any problems or suggestions... please let me know via contact email, or you can leave me a comment on GitHub.</p>
	<p>My family is made up of: A mother with whom I do not share many points of view, a father with whom I do not agree on certain opinions, an older brother whom I hate, a black cat with whom I have a love relationship/ I hate and a beautiful Shiba Inu who is the person in my family that I love the most.</p>

	<p>This photo is from 2011 or 2012, I'm not sure. She is my sister and her name is Kikum√≥.</p><br>
        
	<h2 id="l2">How Is My Life?</h2>
		
	<p>My life is very lonely. Certain circumstances in my life have led me to not be able to maintain much contact with society and with other people in general. And no, I am not a convict, I am a young man who was dragged into solitude.<br>
        This is why I write this website, you will not know my name, but at least you will know my story.</p>
	<p>I have a crush, that type of crush that is a famous person and that I will never meet but I still have this strange hope that I can meet and love her, despite being impossible.<br>
	It makes me very depressed because I know I should forget her, but... I don't know why I can't. When I think about this it makes me want to cry my eyes out.</p>
	<img src="https://i.gifer.com/43AX.gif"><br>
	<p>It is not the first time in my life that I have experienced an unrequited love, I would say that all the loves of my life have been unrequited. This has been going on since I was 4 years old.</p>
	<p>When all the people you have loved in your life do not show the same as you, and also you have been too scared to tell them what you feel, it becomes very difficult and you begin to doubt if you will ever find someone who loves you.</p><br>
	<p>And that is, in general terms, my life.</p><br>
	
	<h2 id="l3">What Is My Story?</h2>
	<p>This is a long story that is not over yet, it has only just begun.</p>
	<p>Do you want to know it? come with me...</p><br>
	<br>
	<p>I was born on September 16, 2006, a very ordinary date. I wonder why most couples think of conceiving on December 24? The truth is that I was not expected, I caught my parents by surprise, but they took it with joy.</p>
	<p>My parents weren't exactly rich. Do you remember the crisis of 2008? Well, my parents were already financially sensitive before that.</p>
	<p>When I was born, my parents already had a son. My older brother was quite rowdy.<br>
	An important fact is that he was born with a sensitivity in the bronchi, this is important to understand the rest of the story.</p>
	<p>My brother was boisterous and certainly difficult. I, however, was extremely quiet, so much so that my parents thought he was deaf: they put the alarm clock to my ear but I didn't wake up. I was like that until I grew up and started screaming so loud that they echoed through all the walls, causing a ringing in the ears. I became a screaming child, yelling my brother's name in anger became part of me.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the doctors told my parents that my brother, 2 years and 9 months older than me, would be chronically asthmatic, among other things. My parents decided to rent a house in a town in the mountains. I entered school there for the first time. She was 4 years old and the dearest companion of all the children in the school. This was so because I was the smallest of all, which made them fight to hold my hand; they were little too, but I was the baby, and I was good at playing the part.</p>
	<p>My mother, my brother and I were there for a few months. I made my first friends there, which were also the last.</p>
	<p>At that school I met my first crush, her name was Sandra. I was too young to have a fully developed loving feeling, but I already felt a kind of pang. That was the first of the four loves of my life.</p> 	
	<p>It turned out that when we went to school, the classmates gave my brother all their viruses and he had trouble breathing. Many times it was impossible for him to breathe and he had to go to the emergency room to see the doctor. He got to so much that he was hospitalized a few times.</p>
	<p>My parents decided to take my brother and me out of school because my brother could no longer be exposed to so much viral load in that way.</p>
	<p>I couldn't attend because it would infect my brother, and once I was out of the system I couldn't go back because home schooling isn't legal in my country.</p>
	<p>And that's how "The Lonely Man" was born...</p><br>
	<p>A few years after that, when I was 6 years old, my brother entered a Waldorf school. I went on weekends and played with the children he had there. This was the case for a few months. There, my brother made friends, he even had a best friend. However, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make any friends. My brother's best friend was also my best friend, but he wasn't mutual, I never managed to become friends with him. The only thing I got was the hatred of a child who was there, he did not attack me physically, but he did verbally: he told me that my ideas were useless and left me out of all the ideas of development of the game.</p>
	<p>I know that there are people who have had it worse, you may be one of them and think that this was nothing compared to what happened to you, but for me it was hard and it made me sad, I did not understand why I was not accepted.</p>
	<p>Actually I did get something else: I fell in love with the older sister of my brother's best friend. I don't remember her name, but I do remember that she was 10 years old and she was very tall. This time the feelings were already more complex and it was really painful. I never had the courage to tell him how I felt, but if I had, it wouldn't have worked out. It was an unrequited love.</p>
	<p>In the end I entered that school, but I only went one day. We went on a trip because my mother had to go see her family in Argentina. On that last day, I met a new student who shared interests with me. We were fantasizing about how to build things and it was one of the best moments of my life. Surely he would have become my best friend and it would have been mutual, but while we were away, it was revealed that the school did not meet certain criteria and was not legal. I never saw anyone again.</p>
	<p>From this moment on, my life stopped having interaction with other people, I only interacted minimally and always hiding a huge secret. I did not exist in the regulated system, legally I was in a town in the mountains. Hiding from people is a huge weight and leaves consequences, you cannot establish relationships because the feeling of falsehood is very strong. You are constantly lying, and that is very hard.</p>
	<p>I was increasingly isolated and alone.</p>
	<p>My life has been difficult, because once you reach adolescence you can no longer continue to interact with the same three people, you need friends, you need to relate, you need to find love...</p>
	<p>As you may have deduced, I have never kissed a girl or a boy. Much less have I had a...racy encounter. Therefore, all my sexual experiences come down to porn.</p>
	<p>I've spent a lot of time imagining what it would be like to kiss someone, what it would be like to come to something else more physical and mental.</p>
	<p>I feel as if I have spent a thousand years alone in a space capsule, as if the capsule is in the middle of the cosmic emptiness, in a place where the light of the stars has not yet reached, so far from anywhere that I will never see another form of life. life like me. The light of the stars does not reach me, I do not see even the slightest sparkle, it is all dark.</p>
	<p>I'm also not sure if anyone will ever read this... maybe what I'm writing will be forgotten somewhere in the memory of a server. It may never be seen by anyone.</p><br>
	<p>In 2019 I fell in love with a TV presenter, her name is Sandra Sabat√©s. Now I was already a teenager and my feelings had a greater complexity. All of these crushes were helped by the fact that I'm a bit more mature than usual. My brother is very immature, so from a young age I adopted the role of older brother. My brother has never been a person that I admire, he has always been a person to compete with and who had to be put up with and managed, I could only control the situation if I made myself the dominant brother, in a subtle and little perceptible sense.</p>
	<p>The thing is, I've always preferred women older than me. It is something curious. When I fell in love with Sandra Sabat√©s, she was 41 years old and I was 13.</p>
	<p>A few months before my 14th birthday, I managed to forget her, but I met someone else: Earlier I mentioned that my sexual experiences are limited to porn; Well, this time I fell in love with a porn star. This is my current crush and the reason why I still love her is because she is more than just love, I fell in love with her at a time when I was about to move on to the next phase of my maturity, she was the trigger and it completely changed my life.</p><br>
	<p>She became my teenage idol, she served as a reference for me to become a completely different person. Until that moment, only one book had changed my life, but this was the first time that I was influenced by a person, a person who was not one of my parents.</p>
 	<p>With her influence I became a person with a perseverance and determination envied by my whole family, a nerd lover of routine and many other more personal things.</p>
	<p>But I've been longing for her to be my friend for too long, I must forget her. I am already the person I want to be, and I owe it indirectly to her. She will never be my friend or anything like that, I must turn the page but it is not something easy.</p>
	<p>I will only say that the initials of her name are "K" and "B".</p><br>
	<br>
	<p>It may seem a bit painful to summarize a whole life in so few Kilobytes, but I don't have many other things to tell. In addition, I do not intend to tell you all the details of my existence, only what has led me to my situation and the causes of my sorrow.</p><br>
 	
	<h2 id="14">What am I going to do now?</h2>
